    Optimizing to get the maximum efficiency out of your plant and equipment requires the
    ability to collect and analyze large amounts of information. Today information streaming from
    sources like simple environmental sensors all the way to complex machine metrics are routinely collected.
    For example, a warehouse may monitor temperature and airflow to ensure product quality. Energy companies monitor power
    grids to ensure reliability. The Oil and Gas Industry monitors operational assets to ensure that they are operating within designed
    limits for longevity. All industries want to monitor these types of measures to ensure employee productivity and safety. The one
    common thread is that all industries want to combine these various metrics to understand the overall impact as opposed to their individual impact.

    Datastax and Cassandra provide a platform that makes it possible to ingest the massive quantities of data produced by
    these sources on a single resilient platform. This reliability and scalability is combined with the ability to perform
    analytics on a single copy of the data resulting in reduced operational complexity and an enhanced opportunity to optimize operations.
