    Weight sensors are used to monitor the consumption and replenishment of snacks in the kitchen.
    They are sensitive enough to detect variations of as little as a single gram.  Utilization tracking allows
    us to know the most popular snacks, forecast reorder points and retire snacks that don't turnover.
